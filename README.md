# ðŸ’¨ Breeze

Breeze is a development dashboard for [Lucky Framework](https://luckyframework.org/) that helps you to debug and fine-tune your application.

## Installation

1. Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     breeze:
       github: luckyframework/breeze
   ```

2. Run `shards install`

3. Add the tasks to your `tasks.cr`:

  ```crystal
  # ...

  # Add this line here
  require "breeze/tasks/**"

  LuckyCli::Runner.run
  ```

4. Run `lucky breeze.install`

5. Include the ActionHelpers in your `src/actions/browser_action.cr`:

  ```crystal
  # ...

  # Add this line
  include Breeze::ActionHelpers
  ```

## Usage

Boot your app locally (`lucky dev`), then open your app in the browser and start using your app.
When you're ready to check out Breeze, look at your development log. You'll see logs similar to this:

```
â–¸ Debug at http://localhost:5000/breeze/requests/6
```

You can visit a specific request, or just go to `/breeze` to browse.
