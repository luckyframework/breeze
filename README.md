# ðŸ’¨ Breeze

Breeze is a development dashboard for [Lucky Framework](https://luckyframework.org/) that helps you to debug and fine-tune your application.

ðŸš§ ** UNDER CONSTRUCTION - Things may change without notice ** ðŸš§

## Installation

1. Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     breeze:
       github: luckyframework/breeze
   ```

2. Run `shards install`
3. Add the require to your `src/shards.cr`:

   ```crystal
   require "avram"
   require "lucky"
   # ...
   # Add this line here
   require "breeze"
   ```

4. Add the tasks to your `tasks.cr`:

  ```crystal
  # ...

  # Add these lines here
  require "breeze/tasks/**"
  require "breeze/db/migrations/**"

  LuckyCli::Runner.run
  ```

5. Run `lucky breeze.install`

6. Run `lucky db.migrate`

## Usage

Boot your app locally (`lucky dev`), then open your app in the browser and start using your app.
When you're ready to check out Breeze, look at your development log. You'll see logs similar to this:

```
â–¸ Debug at http://localhost:5000/breeze/requests/6
```

You can visit a specific request, or just go to `/breeze/requests` to browse.
